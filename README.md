Bash to SQLite
==================================

*Work in progress*

A bash script using a sqlite database to maintain a list of who has access to various ports on a server.

I needed a utility to maintain a list of users who has access to a port range 8000-8200 on two servers. The ports are used by students to run servers and to avoid using each other ports, a list is maintained. At first it was a list on a spreadsheet but with this small utility I moved it into a SQLite database which is maintained by a bash command line script.

You can take the script as an example on how one can use bash together with SQLite to create applications and utilities.



Usage
----------------------------------

TBD.
